1: Introduction
Title: GPS Toll-Based System with Vehicle Animation
Purpose: Demonstrate a system that calculates the shortest path and toll between cities, and animates the vehicle's movement along this path.

2: Components Overview
Technologies Used:
- Tkinter: For the graphical user interface (GUI).
- Pygame: For animating the vehicle movement.
- NetworkX: For creating and managing the graph representing the cities and routes.
- Matplotlib: For visualizing the graph and the shortest path.

3: Graph Representation
Function: create_graph()
Explanation:
- Creates a graph where nodes represent cities, and edges represent routes with weights indicating distances.
- Nodes: Mumbai, Delhi, Bangalore, etc.
- Edges: Connections with weights (e.g., Mumbai to Delhi with a weight of 4).

4: Dijkstra's Algorithm
Function: dijkstra(graph, start, end)
Explanation:
- Implements Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between two cities.
- Uses a priority queue to explore the shortest paths iteratively.
- Returns the shortest path and its cost.

5: Toll Calculation
Function: calculate_toll(path, graph, toll_rate_per_km=0.5)
Explanation:
- Calculates the total toll cost based on the shortest path and a predefined toll rate per kilometer.
- Iterates through the path and sums up the tolls for each segment.

6: Vehicle Animation
Function: animate_vehicle(path, graph)
Explanation:
- Uses Pygame to animate the vehicle moving along the shortest path.
- Displays cities as circles and routes as lines.
- Updates vehicle position smoothly between cities.

7: Event Handlers
Functions: on_calculate(), show_graph()
Explanation:
- on_calculate(): Triggered when the user presses the "Calculate Toll" button. It calculates the shortest path, toll, and starts the animation.
- show_graph(): Triggered when the user presses the "Show Graph" button. It displays the graph with the shortest path highlighted.

8: Graph Visualization
Function: draw_graph(G, path)
Explanation:
- Uses Matplotlib to draw the graph.
- Highlights the shortest path in red.
- Shows node labels and edge weights for better understanding.

9: Tkinter GUI Setup
Explanation:
- Sets up the GUI with input fields for the start and end points.
- Includes buttons to calculate the toll and display the graph.
- Displays the calculated path and toll on the GUI.

10: Code Organization and Structure
Explanation:
- The code is structured into functions for better readability and maintenance.
- Separate functions handle different tasks such as graph creation, path calculation, toll calculation, animation, and event handling.

11: Enhancements and Future Work
Potential Improvements:
- Enhance error handling for user inputs.
- Optimize Pygame animation for larger graphs.
- Improve the user interface with better styling and instructions.
- Add more features like real-time traffic updates or different toll rates.

12: Demonstration
Live Demo:
- Show the GUI.
- Input start and end cities.
- Calculate the shortest path and toll.
- Display the graph.
- Animate the vehicle movement.

13: Conclusion
Summary:
- Integrated Tkinter, Pygame, and NetworkX for a comprehensive toll-based navigation system.
- Demonstrated the calculation of the shortest path, toll costs, and vehicle animation.
- Discussed potential improvements and future enhancements.
