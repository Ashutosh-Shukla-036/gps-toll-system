Finding the Shortest Path:

Dijkstra’s Algorithm: This algorithm is used to find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph. It calculates the minimum distance from the start node to the end node by exploring all possible paths and selecting the one with the smallest cumulative weight (distance).

Calculating the Total Distance:

Once the shortest path is determined, the total distance is calculated by summing the weights of the edges along this path. Each edge in the graph has a weight that represents the distance between two nodes.

Applying the Toll Rate:

The toll is calculated by multiplying the total distance by a predefined toll rate per kilometer. This rate is a constant value that represents the cost per unit distance traveled.

Detailed Steps

Graph Representation: The graph is represented using nodes (points) and edges (connections between points). Each edge has an associated weight that indicates the distance between the connected nodes.

Dijkstra’s Algorithm:
- Initialize the distance to the start node as 0 and to all other nodes as infinity.
- Use a priority queue to explore nodes, starting from the start node.
- For each node, update the distance to its neighbors if a shorter path is found.
- Continue this process until the end node is reached, ensuring the shortest path is found.

Path and Distance Calculation: The shortest path is stored as a sequence of nodes. The total distance is calculated by summing the weights of the edges along this path.

Toll Calculation: The toll is calculated using the formula:
Toll = Total Distance × Toll Rate per Kilometer

For example, if the total distance is 17 kilometers and the toll rate is 0.5 units per kilometer, the toll would be:
Toll = 17 × 0.5 = 8.5 units

Example

Let’s say you want to calculate the toll from point A to point O:

Shortest Path: Using Dijkstra’s algorithm, the shortest path might be ['A', 'E', 'F', 'G', 'I', 'O'].
Total Distance: Sum the weights of the edges along this path:
- A to E: 5
- E to F: 2
- F to G: 2
- G to I: 2
- I to O: 6
- Total distance = 5 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 6 = 17 kilometers

Toll Calculation: If the toll rate is 0.5 units per kilometer:
Toll = 17 × 0.5 = 8.5 units
